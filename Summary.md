# Summary 

The idea is to have a craftsman responsible for the apprenticeship program with full dedication. This would be a rotating roll maybe per batch or per 2/3 batches. With this program we plan to run 3 yearly batches of apprentices and would allow us to enroll less experienced apprentices.
This person would be responsible for:
* Interviewing the candidates with help from others, but needs to coordinate with other craftsman to arrange interview slots
  * Interviews can be arranged in predetermined slots/days if this makes planning easier, candidates would be presented with pre fixed slots to choose from.
* Making sure the program is on track
* Coach all subjects he/she is comfortable with
* Coordinate with other craftsmen for help on specific subjects where a more specialized knowledge is required
* Improvements to the program

We should focus marketing the apprentice batches 3x a year make some noise around them, encourage people to join them as much as possible as a group since this will boost their learning. Internally we will have batches but externally we will not pass this message, since it could hurt our image.
Batch dates could be:
* Winter batch January-March 
* Spring batch May-July 
* Autumn batch September-November

All apprentices will have an assigned mentor, from the start of the program.
The final project should be a collaborative project and apprentices must work as a team. If the batch has diverse tech stacks (Java, C#, Node.JS) they will share the DB and the front end and implement some features in each stack separately.
