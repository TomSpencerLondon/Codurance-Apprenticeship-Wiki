Here are some notes on what we learned by doing remote session and pairings between two offices.

# Sound
- Avoid using the jabra for extended periods (> 15m), it peaks all the sounds and makes it harder to listen and follow. It works much better if everyone has their own headphones.
- Everybody should be muted except the person talking.

In google meet, the shortcut for muting/unmuting is `âŒ˜ + d` or `Ctrl + d`

In slack calls, the shortcut for muting/unmuting is `M`
- Try to use a meeting room.

# Board 
Avoid using the whiteboard and pointing at it with a webcam, it reads badly in general but is even worse when the connection drops.
We had good experiences with https://realtimeboard.com


The screen with the virtual board can be projected to improve collaboration.

# Bandwidth
- Although is nice watching each other, disconnect the cameras to save bandwidth.
- We haven't tried it yet but we've talked about the possibility of having two calls, one only for sound and a different one for screen sharing that can be projected.

# Process
- Agree on some guidelines before starting an exercise. What are the responsibilities of drivers and navigators? How are we going to rotate?
- Work on the same solution. Avoid having one solution for Office 1 and a different one for Office 2. This avoids a "your solution vs my solution" situation and increases collaboration.
- Ask questions and invite the other office to participate, especially if they're being quiet.

# Organisation
- We discussed the possibility of creating a [pairing matrix](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pair-programming-matrix) so there is more collaboration between offices.
