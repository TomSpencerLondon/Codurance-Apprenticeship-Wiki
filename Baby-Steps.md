You have 2 minutes to complete any of the following tasks. Otherwise git reset â€“hard after 2 min:
* Write a failing test (Only task where a failing test is allowed)
* Make a failing test pass
* Refactor
* Think (You cannot repeat this task)
* Hints if you cannot make progress in 2 minutes this is usually due to:
  * You are trying to achieve too much, break your work into smaller steps
  * The code base is in bad shape, you probably need to refactor before moving forward.
