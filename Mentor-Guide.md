# The Mentor’s role

We believe in a volunteer, servant-leader role, supporting the apprentice in the same way that we support our clients.

These are some thoughts about the roles of both mentor and mentee in a successful mentorship.

Note: All of this is just a guideline, not procedure.

## Goal

- Follow up the learning process.
- Guide/Help prioritize/advise the next piece of learning for the apprentice
- Be a role model regarding the culture.
- Lead by example
- Transfer experiences (both good and bad) from previous projects (Codurance and otherwise)
  Transfer [the company´s + your own] principles and values, in the context of the company:
- Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride in their own work, in the apprentices work
- Philosophy, and ‘why?’
- Understand the limitations of the mentor (redirect questions to other people)
- Solve any questions (technical, impostor’s syndrome, etc.)

## Mentors are holistic

Mentorship is for technical and non-technical concerns. There is sufficient crossover between the two that an artificial separation would probably be ineffective. 

Mentees should feel free to use the sessions to ask about any areas of weakness. The session can then be personalised to address these. 

This means a mentorship session is particularly useful for bringing up, and resolving, issues that might be felt to be embarrassing or irrelevant to other apprentices (e.g. a knowledge gap in a basic area: more common for self-taught developers).

## Mentors are a guide, not an instructor

Mentorship is about teaching the mentee to fish, not giving the mentee fish. Mentors should guide their mentees towards solving the snags and problems that they face themselves, perhaps by suggesting alternative ways of looking at the problem, or relevant reading material dealing with something similar.

The exception to this is the rare case where the mentee raises a concern that requires the involvement of upper management.

## Mentors are a window to tacit knowledge

The mentor should be a point of reference for tacit knowledge in Codurance which may not have been communicated before. 

"Tacit knowledge" could include:

- company knowledge that is relevant but not written down anywhere: for example history, conventions, opinions
- the location of company knowledge that _is_ written down (e.g. Trello boards / Google Drive / wiki)
- information that is open to all in Codurance, but often closed in other organisations, so a new person might not think to look for it (e.g. salary info, company financials, recruitment / business development activity)

## Mentors are a channel for giving feedback

The apprenticeship program is continuously evolving and improving thanks to the feedback from all previous apprentices.

Apprentices can use their time with mentors as a way to explore gaps in their knowledge: if there's a pattern of knowledge gaps which is consistent across all the apprentices, it probably means there is an issue with the program. It's useful to recognise this, so that we can fix the program, and plug the knowledge gaps with extra sessions.

There are two main cases when it's useful for a mentor to pass on as feedback some of the details of a mentorship session:

- if there's a problem with the program that could be resolved
- (much rarer) if there's a problem which requires the involvement of higher management to fix

This would generally always be with the explicit prior consent of the mentee.

## Example agendas for mentor sessions

- (General technical concern) I'm getting bogged down when writing acceptance tests, as I get lost in all the set-up code.
- (Specific technical problem) I wrote this kata, and I know it's wrong because it breaks the Liskov principle here, but I don't know how to refactor it to make it right.
- (Basic knowledge gap) I'm really stuck on what the next test should be for this "simple" kata, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
- (General soft-skill concern) I'm worried that sometimes I don't have productive pairing sessions with X, and we both come out of the session feeling a bit exasperated. (X could be a craftsman!)
- Specific soft-skill concern: We wasted a lot of time yesterday trying to get X framework set up; how could I help us be more efficient next time?

## Out of scope

The mentor is not in charge of:

- the apprentice (there’s no hierarchy)
- teaching the apprentice
